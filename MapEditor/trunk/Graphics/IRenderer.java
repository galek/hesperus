/**
This class insulates the outside world from the details of how things are rendered in
pixels on a particular rendering surface. It allows us to render in level coordinates
rather than pixels. Rendering surfaces pass implementations of IRenderer to things
which need to render onto them, rather than passing (for instance) an AWT Graphics
object to use.
