/**
This interface defines global geometric constants. Classes which want to import the
constants, i.e. use unqualified names like CP_BACK instead of GeomConstants.CP_BACK,
simply have to declare themselves as implementing the GeomConstants interface.
Whether it's a good idea to use the unqualified names is a design decision, of course.
