\section{Luck for a Legend}

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}
\emph{Type} & Tutorial \\
\emph{Location} & Blakeney Hall, England \\
\emph{Primary Goal} & Practise rescuing friends from the makeshift `prison' in the basement of Blakeney Hall. \\

\section{In De Cambret's Footsteps}

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}
\emph{Type} & Covert Entry \\
\emph{Location} & Streets of Paris \\
\emph{Primary Goal} & Locate and use the Duc de Cambret's secret tunnel into La Force. \\
\emph{Notes} & The Duc de Cambret escaped from La Force by digging a tunnel, which was never found. It now provides a useful way into La Force for those who know its whereabouts.
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}

\section{A Prince and a Pimpernel}

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}
\emph{Type} & Sneaky Information Gathering \\
\emph{Location} & St. James' Palace, England \\
\emph{Primary Goal} & Find out key information from a rescued aristo without getting caught acting suspiciously. \\
\emph{Notes} &
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
	\begin{list}{\labelitemi}{\leftmargin=1em}
	\item The aristo wants to meet in the gardens to avoid drawing attention.
	\item Chauvelin is at the ball with his men, trying to figure out who the Scarlet Pimpernel is -- you can't get caught acting suspiciously by anyone.
	\item The last time there was a ball at the palace, a drunk lord trampled the Prince's prized turnips -- his guards are out in force to avoid a repeat occurrence.
	\item Obviously you can't kill anyone -- murdering the Prince's guests or guards wouldn't make Percy Blakeney flavour of the month.
	\item Your wife Marguerite is also at the ball, and she doesn't know you're the Pimpernel yet -- you'll need to find a way to distract her or she'll complain to one and all that you've disappeared without trace...
	\end{list}
\end{tabular}

\section{Family Matters}

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}
\emph{Type} & Covert Entry \\
\emph{Location} & Streets of Paris \\
\emph{Primary Goal} & Find your way to an inn overlooking the square, without getting caught by French soldiers. \\
\emph{Notes} &
  \vspace{-\baselineskip}
	\begin{list}{\labelitemi}{\leftmargin=1em}
	\item Marguerite's brother Armand is due to be guillotined in the morning -- there's no time to prepare a rescue from the Bastille.
	\item Paris is locked down tight ready for the execution in the morning -- expect lots of French soldiers.
	\item You'll need to find your way into the city first -- don't try going through the main gate!
	\item The innkeeper is an associate of the Pimpernel -- he promised to leave a ladder lowered for you to get over the city wall.
	\end{list}
\end{tabular}

\section{Off With His Head!}

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}
\emph{Type} & Last-Ditch Rescue (Sniper) \\
\emph{Location} & A public square, Paris \\
\emph{Primary Goal} & Rescue Armand St. Just as he's being taken to the guillotine. \\
\emph{Notes} &
	\vspace{-\baselineskip}
	\begin{list}{\labelitemi}{\leftmargin=1em}
	\item This is the sniper level in the game.
	\item At the end of the level (i.e. once you've dispatched the guards on the prisoner wagon and allowed it to escape), French soldiers will storm the inn -- you'll need to jump out of a back window to escape.
	\end{list}
\end{tabular}

\section{A Boat for England}

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}
\emph{Type} & Escort Rescued Person \\
\emph{Location} & The port of Calais \\
\emph{Primary Goal} & Get Armand aboard a ship for England. \\
\emph{Notes} & At the end of the level, Armand will board the ship and you will be surrounded by French soldiers -- apparently Marguerite followed you without realising you were the Pimpernel, and it allowed Chauvelin to lay a trap for you.
\end{tabular}

\section{Bad Day for a Prison Break}

\begin{tabular}{lp{12cm}}
\emph{Type} & Prison Escape \\
\emph{Location} & The Bastille, Paris \\
\emph{Primary Goal} & Make your escape any way you can - you're due to be executed in the morning! \\
\emph{Notes} &
	\vspace{-\baselineskip}
	\begin{list}{\labelitemi}{\leftmargin=1em}
	\item You've got limited time for this mission - the Paris mob has a mind to storm the Bastille and kill everyone in it (guillotining's behind schedule and Robespierre's disinclined to stop them!); you probably don't want to be there when they arrive...
	\item They're keeping a pretty tight watch on your cell - the Scarlet Pimpernel is too great a prize to let slip easily.
	\item You should probably rescue Marguerite - she's now in the Bastille too.
	\end{list}
\end{tabular}
