----------
Structural
----------

* Replace hr2cbrush with hbrushdivider
* Add hdetailer

----
hbsp
----

* Iff constructing a rendering tree, read in hint planes from the .hpl and use them during construction

-------------
hbrushdivider
-------------

* Read in each brush from the .bru
* Output NORMAL brushes (no need to include their functions) to the .rbr (rendering brushes)
* Output DETAIL polygons (i.e. the detail brush faces) to the .dgm (detail geometry)
* Output HINT planes (i.e. the planes of HINT brush faces marked with the hint texture) to the .hpl (hint planes)
* Output (converted) NORMAL/COLLISION brushes (no need to include their functions) to the .cbr (collision brushes)
* Output FOG/WATER brushes (include their functions) to the .sbr (special brushes)

---------
hdetailer
---------

* Run after the second rendering tree is constructed
* Read in the .rt2 and .dgm
* Clip each detail brush face to the rendering tree and add face fragments to the relevant leaves
* Output the result to the .rt3

-------
hportal
-------

* Update this to use the tree node split planes (i.e. including any hint planes), not the planes of the tree polygons

---------
mef2input
---------

* Output all the brushes (including their functions) to a .bru file
