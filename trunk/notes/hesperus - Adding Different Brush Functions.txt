Changes Required
================

----------
Structural
----------

* Replace hr2cbrush with hdivide
* Add hdetailer

----
hbsp
----

* Iff constructing a rendering tree, read in hint planes from the .rhp and use them during construction

---------
hdetailer
---------

* Run after the second rendering tree is constructed
* Read in the .rt2 and .dgm
* Clip each detail brush face to the rendering tree and add face fragments to the relevant leaves
* Output the result to the .rt3

-------
hdivide
-------

* Read in each brush from the .bru
* Output NORMAL brushes (no need to include their functions) to the .rbr (rendering brushes)
* Output DETAIL polygons (i.e. the detail brush faces) to the .dgm (detail geometry)
* Output HINT planes (i.e. the planes of HINT brush faces marked with the hint texture) to the .rhp (rendering hint planes)
* Output (converted) NORMAL/COLLISION brushes (no need to include their functions) to the .cbr (collision brushes)
* Output FOG/WATER brushes (include their functions) to the .sbr (special brushes)

-------
hportal
-------

* Update this to use the tree node split planes (i.e. including any hint planes), not the planes of the tree polygons

---------
mef2input
---------

* Output all the brushes (including their functions) to a .bru file

==================
Migration Strategy
==================

-------
Phase 1
-------

1) Get mef2input to output the brushes to a .bru (whilst leaving the existing functionality in place).
2) Implement hbrushdivider and test it (outside the toolchain).
3) When it works, remove the existing functionality from mef2input, update the toolchain to use hbrushdivider and remove hr2cbrush.

------------
Phase 2 or 3
------------

1) Implement hdetailer and test it.
2) Update the toolchain to use hdetailer.

------------
Phase 2 or 3
------------

1) Update hportal to use the tree node split planes.
2) Update hbsp to use hint planes when building rendering trees.
