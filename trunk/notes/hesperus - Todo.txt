Easy

* Walk/run etc. - sort out where the various different entity speeds are coming from (I'd suggest the definitions file).
* Add verbose modes for tools (particularly hvis, where it's helpful to see current progress).
* Sort out the mess of functions in FieldIO.

Medium

* Implement some AI yokes (it probably makes sense to have composite yokes so that we can switch between different yokes for different behaviours - could we have yoke trees corresponding to goal trees?).
* Separate viewers from entities: we shouldn't have to see through the eyes of an entity, we should be able to position the camera anywhere we like.
* View frustum culling.

Hard

* Update MapEditor to allow placement of entities, etc. Some sort of scripted paths should be added as well.
* Implement AI scripting.
* Implement collision handling between dynamic objects.
* Reimplement hlight to allow dynamic lighting.
* Implement weapons and projectiles.
