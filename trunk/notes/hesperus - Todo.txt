Easy

* Split FileSectionUtil into a class for each type of section: it's a 'kitchen sink' class at the moment.
* Walk/run etc. - sort out where the various different entity speeds are coming from (I'd suggest the entity definition file, possibly).
* Add verbose modes for tools (particularly hvis, where it's helpful to see current progress).
* Separate viewers from entities: we shouldn't have to see through the eyes of an entity, we should be able to position the camera anywhere we like.
* Add loading screenshots for the various different game levels and update GameState_Load to use them.

Medium

* Implement some AI yokes (it probably makes sense to have composite yokes so that we can switch between different yokes for different behaviours - could we have yoke trees corresponding to goal trees?).

* Detail and hint brushes to improve vis/nav. This will require changes to both MapEditor and the toolchain.
* Update MapEditor to allow placement of entities, lights, etc. Ultimately scripted paths should be added as well.
* Write the model loading and animation code.
