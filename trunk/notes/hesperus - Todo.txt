Easy
----

* !!! Check out MapEditor from the hesperus repository on my laptop. !!!
* Move the entity loading code out of EntityManager to sort out a dependency issue.
* Walk/run etc. - sort out where the various different entity speeds are coming from (I'd suggest the entity definition file, possibly - the format for that also needs to be sorted out though).
* Add verbose modes for tools (particularly hvis, where it's helpful to see current progress).

------
Medium
------

* Implement some AI yokes (it probably makes sense to have composite yokes so that we can switch between different yokes for different behaviours - could we have yoke trees corresponding to goal trees?).

----
Hard
----

* Detail and hint brushes to improve vis/nav. This will require changes to both MapEditor and the toolchain.
* Update MapEditor to allow placement of entities, lights, etc. Ultimately scripted paths should be added as well.
