* Yokeable entities can have a yoke attached to them.
* Yokes have read-only access to the level state. They yield a sequence of movement commands.

The update process therefore works as follows:

1) The yoke for each entity is invoked in turn to generate the desired movement commands. In the case of the player, the moves generated are based on user input.
2) The movement commands are pushed onto the command queue and executed in turn, resolving collisions where necessary.
