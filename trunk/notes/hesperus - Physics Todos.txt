Short-Term / Urgent
-------------------

* Make sure the physics system is being set up properly (i.e. with appropriate contact resolvers etc.)
* Try and get rid of the gravity special-case.
* Move recent planes into CmpMovement.

Long-Term
---------

* Implement a proper contact batching processor.
* Implement hard constraints (possibly).
