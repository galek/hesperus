-------------------
Short-Term / Urgent
-------------------

* Implement world collisions properly.
  - Need a way to get recent transition planes (embed them in the physics object and rewrite the movement code to use these instead).
* Implement a new movement component and get rid of MoveFunctions.
* Get rid of GameState_Level::do_physics() and replace it with GameState_Level::do_physics_ex().
  - Needs resting contacts to be handled properly.
  - Needs world collisions to be implemented properly.
* Make sure the physics system is being set up properly (i.e. with appropriate contact resolvers etc.)

Long-Term

* Implement a proper contact batching processor.
* Implement hard constraints (possibly).
